# Stagnate Time
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-stagnate-time.webp|150]]

You examine the time stream in a particular area, then proceed to stick a few metaphorical pins into it, thickening and slowing down the flow of time until it rumbles along like a river of molasses. Any creature that begins its turn in the area must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is [[Slowed 1]] this turn.

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Slowed 1|Slowed 2]] this turn.
