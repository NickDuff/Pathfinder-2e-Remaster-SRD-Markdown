# Horrific Visage
![[icons-magic-unholy-strike-body-explode-disintegrate.webp|150]]

You briefly transform your features into the horrific visage of a hag, striking fear into your enemies. Foes in the area must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Success** The foe is unaffected.

**Failure** The foe is [[Frightened 1]].

**Critical Failure** The foe is [[Frightened 1|Frightened 2]].

* * *

**Heightened (5th)** Foes in the area are [[Frightened 1]] on a success, [[Frightened 1|Frightened 2]] on a failure, and [[Frightened 1|Frightened 3]] and [[Fleeing]] for 1 round on a critical failure. They are still unaffected on a critical success.
