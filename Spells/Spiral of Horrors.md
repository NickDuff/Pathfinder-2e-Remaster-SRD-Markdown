# Spiral of Horrors
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-dread-aura.webp|150]]

Shades and spirits howl and whirl around you in a display that strikes fear into the hearts of all who witness it. Enemies in the area are [[Frightened 1]] and can't reduce their frightened value below 1 for the spell's duration.
